Introduction

 This is the 'ioko-tapestry-commons' project.

 This project includes a series of {{{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html}GPL}} licensed components to assist in  building tapestry websites.

The Projects

 * {{{./tapestry-caching/}Tapestry Caching}} - Provides caching of the generated HTML for a page snippet

 * {{{./tapestry-swfObject/}Tapestry SWF Object}} - Provides a component that adds a SWF object to the page and includes the 'swfobject' javascript library. This also provides an 'easy' way of binding flashvars from your page classes.

 * {{{./tapestry-cacheControl/}Tapestry Cache Control}} - Provides a component that adds HTTP headers to control page caching based on global settings and page specific annotations

 * {{{./tapestry-javascript/}Tapestry Javascript Stacks}} - Provides a component that provides a contribution point for javascript to be added to every page and de-duplicated.

 If you haven't already added it you need to add the tapestry.formos.com maven repository to your POM.

 <repositories>
        <!-- Chances are, this one is known because that's where this very POM comes from! -->
        <repository>
            <id>tapestry</id>
            <url>http://tapestry.formos.com/maven-repository</url>
